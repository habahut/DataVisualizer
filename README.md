This was part of a full data visualization package for LogMeIn's Join.Me service

The full package took the raw data dumps from their performance analysis, converted it to CSV format
and then again into the tables at the top of each .html page. The service was hosted on a web server
I developed using Node.JS and hosted on a virtual machine on the company's local network. Anyone in 
the building could upload a data log file, the program would analyze it and direct them to the newly
created .html page. They could also view any log files uploaded to the server, and easily share the
results with each other by sending the address of the log file in question.

The current page only displays test data, but it shows off the capabilities of the program to explore
and compare all the metrics available. To run it, simply open the .html page in Chrome or Firefox.
